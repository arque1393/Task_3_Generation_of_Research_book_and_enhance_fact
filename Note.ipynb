    "# Finding Free alternatives Models to Open AI for Legal Tasks\n",
    "Objective: The primary goal of this task is to investigate alternative free of cost models to OpenAI, such as Bard or any relevant open-source models, to showcase similar functionality to OpenAI without incurring costs.\n",
    "Features to Implement:\n",
    "1.\tResearchbook Name Generation:\n",
    "- Description: Develop a mechanism to generate research book names based on legal queries. Use the model you found to achieve the desired responses. \n",
    "- Examples:(For the given query, the research book names generated by GPT are as follows) \n",
    "    - Query: \"Siblings Murder\"  \n",
    "        - Research Book Name: \" Analyzing Murder Cases: Relevant Judgments and Legal Insights \"\n",
    "    - Query: \" Cheque Bounce \"  \n",
    "\t    - Research Book Name: \" Cheque Bounce Chronicles: Legal Perspectives and Summaries \"\n",
    "    - Query: \" Murder \"  \n",
    "        - Research Book Name: \"Understanding Sibling Murder Cases: Relevant Judgments and Legal Strategies\"\n",
    "    - Query: \" Is a last will considered the final will of a person? \"\n",
    "        - Research Book Name: \" Finality of Last Wills: Legal Implications and Precedents\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2.\tGenerating Enhanced Facts:\n",
    "- Description: Develop a mechanism to generate enhanced legal facts from the given facts. This involves transforming standard facts into more detailed and context-rich information. Use the model you found to achieve the desired responses.\n",
    "- Examples:(Given facts and corresponding enhanced facts generated by GPT)\n",
    "    - Fact: \"Loan pending with the bank.\"\n",
    "        - Enhanced Fact: \"A loan is pending with a bank.\"\n",
    "    - Fact: \"Physical or mental torture.\"\n",
    "        - Enhanced Fact: \"The victim suffered from torture, whether physical or mental.\"\n",
    "    - Fact: \"The accused did not create or submit forged documents to the authority.\"\n",
    "        - Enhanced Fact: \"The defendant did not produce or present falsified records to the governing body.\"\n",
